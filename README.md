## Physical Computing Final Project
Dummy owl which will analyze pi-camera data to figure out either fashion trends, if students tend to leave on bike, if they leave with backpacks, etc. A microphone will be used to analyze overall volume of the environment. A daylight sensor will help the owl decide when to sleep (or sleep only certain sensors). Tweets will be produced related to the data; either count of people walking/biking, average color of shirt, average/max volume of the day. Data will be visualized using Dash. See sentdex tutorial on YouTube.
